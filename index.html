                    <span class="leaderText">bout me:</span> 
                    I graduated from Brown University in December of 2021, with a degree in philosophy and literary arts. My philosophy capstone was a critique of Frans de Waal's theory of animal morality. I also completed an honors thesis in literary arts, entitled <i>The Fairy Queen</i>. In June, I began a road trip around the continental United States, starting in New York. The trip ended in Rhode Island, at the Green Line Apothecary, on October 27th. Now, I am working, writing, reading and (eventually) applying to law school.

                    I was born in Denver, Colorado in 1999. Since then, I have lived in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Rhode Island. As a child, I wanted to be - at various times - an astronaut, a wizard and a writer. Unsurprisingly, I read a lot of fiction. Currently, I am reading <i>The Upswing</i> by Robert Putnam, <i>The Federalist</i> and Lemony Snicket's <i>Poison for Breakfast</i>.
