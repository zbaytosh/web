                    I am a student at Brown University studying Literary Arts and Philosophy. In the Fall, I will be taking a leave of absence to work on a political campaign, before returning in January of 2021 to begin my senior year. My current plan is to complete honors in Literary Arts and complete a thesis in Philosophy on the biological basis of consciousness.

                    My primary philosophical interest is the nature of consciousness. As we get an increasingly clear picture of how the physical structures of our brain determine our experiences, the mystery of why we have experiences at all (and what they really consist in) only deepens. The answer is significant, because consciousness lies at the heart of almost every signifcant philosophical question worth asking: from ethics to aesthetics, from logic to political philosophy. I think progress in these fields has been hampered by an unwillingness to adress the fundamental role that consciousness plays in our lives---and to grapple with the significant challenges that poses to a purely physicalist view of the universe.

                    I have been writing on and off since I was twelve, mostly short pieces which sometimes turn into short stories. At Brown I have taken several writing seminars, as well as courses in nature writing, Russian literature, Old English (translation and history) and the history of the English language. I have recently been thinking a lot about the way fantasy and science fiction can tell small scale interpersonal stories (in addition to the world-hanging-in-the-balance stories I grew up loving). Kazuo Ishiguro's work, in particular the <i>The Buried Giant</i> and <i>Never Let Me Go</i>, has been as thought provoking as it is wonderful.

                    <span class="leaderText">eading and Listening:</span> Currently I am reading <i>The Problems of Philosophy</i> by Bertrand Russell, <i>Where the Crawdads Sing</i> by Delia Owens, and <i>The Mist</i> by Stephen King.  I also listen to audiobooks and podcasts in my free time. I am currently listening to <i>Why Fish Don't Exist</i> by Lulu Miller (the former host of "Invisibilia"). In terms of podcasts I would recommend <i>On the Media</i> (News/Political Commentary), <i>Radiolab</i> (Science/Social Science), <i>Invisibilia</i> (Science/Social Science), and <i>Amicus</i> (Law) to anyone interested in listening to something new.

                    For some time now, I have been keeping up with the Supreme Court's oral argument and opinion calendars. The opinions and arguments are easier to follow than you might expect, and due to the nature of the news cycle (and the way the Court releases its decisions) reporters frequently pass over important details in the scramble to write stories on big cases. Perhaps more frequently, signficant cases pass under the radar with hardly any mention in the news. You can find the Court's oral arguments <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/oral_arguments.aspx">here</a> under Argument Audio, and their most recent opinions <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/opinions.aspx">here</a> under Opinions of the Court. For my thoughts about the current Court term see the <a href="law.html">Law</a> section linked above.
